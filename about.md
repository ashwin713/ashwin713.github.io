I hail from one of the southern states of India, specifically God's Own Country - *Kerala*. To me, **making a difference**  in a positive way is the way to go. I am an Open Source enthusiast and an ardent follower of *Ubuntu*.

Coding for me is a passion, it ignites the mind. I believe that in the right hands it can change the world for better. Let's code to make the world a better place.

Peace out !
