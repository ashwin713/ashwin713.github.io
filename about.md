I hail from South India, specifically God's Own Country - *Kerala*. To me **making a difference**,  in a positive way is the way to go. I am an Open Source enthusiast and an ardent follower of *Ubuntu*.

Coding for me is a passion, it ignites the mind. Coding is a very powerful tool, In the right hands it can change the world in a better way. 
Peace out !
